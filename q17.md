A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket. What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
* A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
* B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.
* C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.
* D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.EditLet's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:

EC2 instances need access to S3 bucket
Need secure access method
Solution should follow AWS best practices


Analyze each option:

A) IAM role:

Designed for AWS services
Temporary credentials
No need to manage access keys
AWS recommended approach
Can be attached to EC2 instances

B) IAM policy:

Can't be attached directly to EC2 instances
Needs to be attached to users, groups, or roles
Not a complete solution by itself

C) IAM group:

Used for grouping IAM users
Cannot be attached to EC2 instances
Not designed for service access

D) IAM user:

Meant for human users
Would require managing access keys
Not secure for EC2 instances
Against AWS best practices


Best solution analysis:

Need secure access method
Must follow AWS best practices
Should be easy to manage
Must work with EC2 instances



The correct answer is A: Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
This is the best solution because:

IAM roles are designed for AWS services like EC2
Provides temporary security credentials
No need to manage access keys
Follows AWS security best practices
Can be attached to running EC2 instances
Automatically rotates credentials
Easy to update permissions as needed
