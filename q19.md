company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets. A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
* A. Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
* B. Create an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
* C. Deploy a transit gateway in the inspection VPConfigure route tables to route the incoming packets through the transit gateway.
* D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.


Let me analyze this step by step:

Key requirements:
All traffic must be inspected before reaching web servers
Third-party firewall appliance is in a separate inspection VPC
Need lowest operational overhead
Appliance accepts IP packets
Evaluate each option: A. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
Cannot natively route traffic to another VPC for inspection
Would require complex networking setup Incorrect.
B. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Cannot handle IP packet inspection
Not suitable for network security appliances Incorrect.
C. Transit Gateway
Requires complex route table management
Higher operational overhead
Would need additional configuration for packet inspection Incorrect.
D. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
Specifically designed for inline network appliances
Built-in health checks and scalability
GWLB endpoints provide transparent network integration
Minimal operational overhead
Handles traffic at the network level (Layer 3)
Perfect for transparent inspection use cases This is CORRECT.
Why Gateway Load Balancer is the best solution:
Purpose-built for network appliance deployments
Transparently intercepts traffic using GENEVE protocol
Maintains connection stickiness
Automatically scales with demand
Minimal configuration needed
Native integration with VPC networking
Implementation overview using GWLB:
Deploy GWLB in inspection VPC
Create GWLB endpoint in application VPC
Configure routes to direct traffic through endpoint
Traffic automatically flows through firewall appliance
No complex routing or management required
Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The Gateway Load Balancer solution provides the most efficient and least operationally intensive way to implement the required traffic inspection. It's specifically designed for this use case and requires minimal ongoing management compared to the other options.
