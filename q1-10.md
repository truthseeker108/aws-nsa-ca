Let's solve this step by step:

1) Key requirements:
   - Process orders through API Gateway
   - Must maintain order sequence (FIFO - First In, First Out)
   - Orders must be processed in the exact order received

2) Analyze each option:

A) API Gateway with SNS:
   - SNS is pub/sub service
   - Doesn't guarantee message ordering
   - Could process messages out of order

B) API Gateway with SQS FIFO:
   - FIFO queues guarantee ordering
   - Exactly-once processing
   - Messages processed in exact sequence
   - Can integrate with Lambda for processing

C) API Gateway authorizer:
   - Just handles authentication
   - Would block concurrent requests
   - Not a queuing solution
   - Poor scalability

D) API Gateway with SQS standard:
   - Standard queues don't guarantee order
   - Best-effort ordering only
   - Messages could be processed out of sequence

3) Best solution analysis:
   - Need guaranteed ordering
   - Must be scalable
   - Should be serverless
   - Must maintain sequence

The correct answer is B: Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

This is the best solution because:
- SQS FIFO queues guarantee exact ordering
- Messages processed in sequence they were sent
- Integrates seamlessly with Lambda
- Maintains scalability
- Provides exactly-once processing
- Ensures no duplicate processing
- Cost-effective serverless solution
