A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
* A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
* B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
* C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
* D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.


Let's think about this step by step:

We need to restrict S3 bucket access to only users within the AWS Organization
The solution should work for all accounts in the organization
It should be maintainable with minimal operational overhead
Let's analyze each option:
A) Using aws:PrincipalOrgID:

Directly checks if the requesting principal belongs to the organization
Requires only one condition in the bucket policy
Automatically works for all accounts in the organization
Low maintenance as it's tied to the organization ID which rarely changes
B) Using aws:PrincipalOrgPaths:

More granular control based on OU structure
Requires creating and maintaining OUs
More complex policy to maintain
Higher operational overhead
C) Using CloudTrail monitoring:

Requires setting up CloudTrail
Needs custom automation to update bucket policy
Complex to maintain
High operational overhead
D) Using aws:PrincipalTag:

Requires tagging all users
Need to maintain tags as users join/leave
High operational overhead
Risk of missing users
Considering the requirement for LEAST operational overhead:
Option A requires minimal setup and maintenance
Other options require significant ongoing maintenance
The correct answer is A: Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.

This is the most efficient solution because:

It's a one-time setup
Automatically applies to all accounts in the organization
No ongoing maintenance required
Automatically handles new accounts added to the organization
No additional services or configurations needed

A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time. What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?
* A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
* B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
* C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
* D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server


Let's solve this step by step:

Understand the current problem:
Two EC2 instances in different AZs
Each has its own EBS volume storing documents
Users see different documents depending on which server they hit
ALB is distributing requests between servers
Need all documents to be visible at once
Analyze each option:
A) Copying data between EBS volumes:

Would require constant synchronization
Complex to manage
Risk of data inconsistency
Doesn't scale well
B) ALB directing to specific server:

Doesn't solve the fundamental issue
Documents would still be split
Wouldn't provide access to all documents
C) Using Amazon EFS:

Provides shared file system across AZs
Automatically available to all EC2 instances
Built for this exact use case
Scales automatically
Maintains consistency
D) Configuring ALB to send to both servers:

Complex to implement
Would require application changes
Higher latency
Doesn't scale well
Best solution analysis:
Need shared access to files
Must work across AZs
Should be scalable
Should maintain consistency
The correct answer is C: Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS.

This is the best solution because:

EFS is designed for shared file access across multiple EC2 instances
Provides consistent view of all documents
Works seamlessly across AZs
Highly available and durable
Scales automatically
Eliminates need for manual data synchronization
Simplifies the architecture

A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability. Which solution meets these requirements?
* A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
* B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
* C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
* D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.


Let's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:
Decouple message ingestion from processing
Handle sudden spikes up to 100,000 messages/second
Multiple consumers need access
Need scalability
Analyze each option:
A) Kinesis Data Analytics:

Meant for real-time analytics
Not designed for message queuing
Wrong service for this use case
B) EC2 with Auto Scaling:

Doesn't decouple the system
Still tightly coupled architecture
Scaling might not be fast enough for sudden spikes
C) Kinesis Data Streams with single shard:

Single shard limited to 1,000 records/second for writes
Cannot handle 100,000 messages/second
Would create a bottleneck
D) SNS with SQS subscriptions:

SNS can handle high throughput
SQS provides decoupling
Fan-out architecture
Each consumer gets its own queue
Auto-scales to handle spikes
Provides retry and error handling
Best solution analysis:
Need high throughput

A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received. Which solution will meet these requirements?
* A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
* B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
* C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
* D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.


Let's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:
Process orders through API Gateway
Must maintain order sequence (FIFO - First In, First Out)
Orders must be processed in the exact order received
Analyze each option:
A) API Gateway with SNS:

SNS is pub/sub service
Doesn't guarantee message ordering
Could process messages out of order
B) API Gateway with SQS FIFO:

FIFO queues guarantee ordering
Exactly-once processing
Messages processed in exact sequence
