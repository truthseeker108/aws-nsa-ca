 company hosts a data lake on AWS. The data lake consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company needs a reporting solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access. Which solution will meet these requirements?
* A. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate IAM roles.
* B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups.
* C. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to produce reports. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.
* D. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to access data within Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. Generate reports by using Amazon Athena. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.


Let's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:
Need data visualization solution
Must combine multiple data sources (S3 and RDS PostgreSQL)
Need different access levels:
Full access for management team
Limited access for others
Must be a reporting solution
Analyze each option:
A) QuickSight with IAM roles:

IAM roles are for AWS services
Not designed for user-level access control
Doesn't provide granular user permissions
B) QuickSight with users and groups:

Purpose-built for data visualization
Supports multiple data sources
Built-in user/group management
Granular access control
Easy sharing capabilities
C) AWS Glue + S3 reports:

More complex to implement
No built-in visualization
Manual report generation
Requires custom development
D) Athena + S3 reports:

Complex setup
No native visualization
Manual report creation
Requires additional development
Best solution analysis:
Need integrated visualization
Must handle multiple data sources
Need user-level access control
Should be easy to maintain
The correct answer is B: Create an analysis in QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups.

This is the best solution because:

QuickSight is purpose-built for data visualization
Supports both S3 and RDS data sources
Built-in user and group management
Granular access control capabilities
Easy dashboard sharing
No custom development needed
Cost-effective solution
Low maintenance overhead
