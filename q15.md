A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud. Which solution will meet these requirements?
* A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
* B. Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
* C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
* D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.EditLet's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:

Need to protect VPC traffic
Must inspect traffic flows
Must filter traffic
Similar to on-premises inspection server
Need deep packet inspection capabilities


Analyze each option:

A) Amazon GuardDuty:

Threat detection service
Analyzes logs and metadata
Doesn't perform real-time traffic inspection
No traffic filtering capabilities

B) Traffic Mirroring:

Only copies traffic for analysis
Doesn't provide filtering
No built-in inspection capabilities
Just a traffic copy mechanism

C) AWS Network Firewall:

Purpose-built for traffic inspection and filtering
Stateful and stateless rules
Deep packet inspection
Network-level protection
Similar to traditional firewall appliances

D) AWS Firewall Manager:

Management service for security rules
Doesn't provide inspection/filtering itself
Used to manage other security services
Not a firewall solution itself


Best solution analysis:

Need actual traffic inspection
Must filter traffic
Should be network-level solution
Must be similar to on-premises setup



The correct answer is C: Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
This is the best solution because:

Provides deep packet inspection
Supports stateful and stateless filtering
Directly replaces on-premises inspection server
Built specifically for VPC traffic protection
Centrally managed
Scalable and highly available
Native AWS service integration
Supports custom rules and policies
