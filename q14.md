A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance. The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. Which solution will meet these requirements?
* A. Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
* B. Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
* C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
* D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.EditLet's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:

Need database scalability
Must handle unpredictable read workloads
High availability required
Read-heavy workload
Must scale automatically
Currently using MySQL 8.0


Analyze each option:

A) Amazon Redshift:

Data warehouse solution
Not designed for OLTP
Single node lacks high availability
Not ideal for ecommerce transactions

B) RDS Single-AZ:

Single-AZ lacks high availability
Manual scaling of read replicas
Doesn't meet automatic scaling requirement

C) Aurora with Multi-AZ and Auto Scaling:

Native MySQL compatibility
Automatic scaling of read replicas
Multi-AZ for high availability
Auto scaling based on load
Designed for read-heavy workloads

D) ElastiCache with Spot Instances:

Caching solution, not a database
Spot instances not reliable for database
Doesn't provide data persistence
Not suitable as primary database


Best solution analysis:

Need automatic scaling
Must maintain high availability
Should handle read-heavy workload
Must be reliable



The correct answer is C: Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
This is the best solution because:

Aurora provides automatic scaling of read replicas
Multi-AZ deployment ensures high availability
Compatible with MySQL workloads
Auto Scaling handles unpredictable read loads
Built-in replication and failover
Designed for high performance
Cost-effective as you only pay for what you use
Seamless scaling without application changes
