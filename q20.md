A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance. A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment. Which solution will meet these requirements?
* A. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.
* B. Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.
* C. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.
* D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.EditLet me analyze this step by step:

Requirements:

Clone large amounts of production data to test environment
Changes to cloned data must not affect production
Need consistently high I/O performance
Minimize cloning time
Same region operation


Evaluate each option:
A. EBS snapshots to instance store volumes

✗ Instance store volumes are temporary
✗ Data lost when instance stops/terminates
✗ Doesn't provide consistent I/O performance
Incorrect.

B. EBS Multi-Attach

✗ Multi-Attach is for sharing volumes between instances
✗ Changes would affect production environment
✗ Doesn't meet isolation requirement
Incorrect.

C. Initialize new EBS volumes before snapshot restore

✗ Initializing volumes first adds unnecessary time
✗ No benefit to performance
✗ Adds complexity without advantage
Incorrect.

D. Fast snapshot restore

✓ Eliminates need to initialize volumes
✓ Provides immediate high I/O performance
✓ Fastest way to create volumes from snapshots
✓ Maintains data isolation
This is CORRECT.


Why Fast Snapshot Restore is best:

Eliminates the latency of first-access to blocks
Volumes created from FSR-enabled snapshots deliver full performance immediately
No need for volume initialization
Keeps production and test environments completely separate
Specifically designed to minimize time to create and access volumes from snapshots


Implementation steps:

Take EBS snapshots of production volumes
Enable fast snapshot restore on these snapshots
Create new volumes from snapshots
Attach new volumes to test EC2 instances
Begin using test environment with full performance



Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Fast snapshot restore is specifically designed for this use case where you need to quickly create volumes from snapshots with immediate full performance. It's the only option that both minimizes creation time and ensures consistent high I/O performance from the start.
