An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
* A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
* B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
* C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
* D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
* E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.EditLet me think about this step by step:

Requirements analysis:

Need to process images automatically when uploaded
Solution must be durable and stateless
Need to store original and compressed images in S3
Need automated processing with Lambda


Evaluate each option:
A. SQS queue + S3 notification

✓ Durable: SQS is highly durable
✓ Stateless: Queue messages are independent
✓ Automatic: S3 events trigger automatically
This is a CORRECT option.

B. Lambda using SQS as source

✓ Durable: Both SQS and Lambda are durable services
✓ Stateless: No state maintained between executions
✓ Automatic: Lambda processes messages automatically
This is a CORRECT option.

C. Lambda monitoring S3 + in-memory file

✗ Not durable: In-memory file is lost if Lambda restarts
✗ Not stateless: Maintains state in memory
Incorrect.

D. EC2 monitoring queue + text file

✗ Not stateless: Maintains state in text file
✗ Less durable: EC2 instance could fail
Incorrect.

E. EventBridge + SNS email

✗ Not automatic: Requires manual intervention via email
✗ Doesn't meet processing requirements
Incorrect.


Best combination:
Options A and B create a robust architecture because:


S3 events trigger notifications to SQS (A)
Lambda processes messages from SQS automatically (B)
Both are fully managed, durable, and stateless services
Provides automatic scaling and reliable message processing

Therefore, the correct answers are A and B.
This creates a reliable event-driven architecture where:

Image uploads trigger S3 notifications
Notifications are durably stored in SQS
Lambda automatically processes these messages
Successfully processed messages are deleted from the queue
