A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
* A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
* B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
* C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
* D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
Let's think about this step by step:

We need to restrict S3 bucket access to only users within the AWS Organization

The solution should work for all accounts in the organization
It should be maintainable with minimal operational overhead


Let's analyze each option:

A) Using aws:PrincipalOrgID:

Directly checks if the requesting principal belongs to the organization
Requires only one condition in the bucket policy
Automatically works for all accounts in the organization
Low maintenance as it's tied to the organization ID which rarely changes

B) Using aws:PrincipalOrgPaths:

More granular control based on OU structure
Requires creating and maintaining OUs
More complex policy to maintain
Higher operational overhead

C) Using CloudTrail monitoring:

Requires setting up CloudTrail
Needs custom automation to update bucket policy
Complex to maintain
High operational overhead

D) Using aws:PrincipalTag:

Requires tagging all users
Need to maintain tags as users join/leave
High operational overhead
Risk of missing users


Considering the requirement for LEAST operational overhead:

Option A requires minimal setup and maintenance
Other options require significant ongoing maintenance



The correct answer is A: Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
This is the most efficient solution because:

It's a one-time setup
Automatically applies to all accounts in the organization
No ongoing maintenance required
Automatically handles new accounts added to the organization
No additional services or configurations needed
