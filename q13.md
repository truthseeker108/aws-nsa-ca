A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
* A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule. Most Voted
* B. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Systems Manager by creating a secure string parameter. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Systems Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
* C. Store the credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket that has server-side encryption (SSE) enabled. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke an AWS Lambda function to rotate the credentials.
* D. Encrypt the credentials as secrets by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) multi-Region customer managed keys. Store the secrets in an Amazon DynamoDB global table. Use an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the secrets from DynamoDB. Use the RDS API to rotate the secrets.EditLet's solve this step by step:

Key requirements:

Need to rotate RDS MySQL credentials
Must work across multiple regions
Must be automated
Need least operational overhead
Monthly schedule


Analyze each option:

A) AWS Secrets Manager:

Built-in support for database credential rotation
Native multi-region replication
Automated rotation scheduling
Purpose-built for this use case
Minimal setup and maintenance

B) Systems Manager Parameter Store:

No built-in credential rotation
Would need custom rotation solution
More operational overhead
Not designed specifically for secret rotation

C) S3 + EventBridge + Lambda:

Requires custom code
High operational overhead
Manual management of encryption
Complex to maintain

D) KMS + DynamoDB + Lambda:

Most complex solution
Requires extensive custom code
High maintenance overhead
Manual encryption management


Best solution analysis:

Need automated rotation
Must work across regions
Should minimize operational work
Must be secure



The correct answer is A: Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
This is the best solution because:

Purpose-built for credential rotation
Built-in support for RDS credentials
Native multi-region replication
Automated scheduling
Minimal operational overhead
Handles encryption automatically
Provides audit trail
Integrates directly with RDS
